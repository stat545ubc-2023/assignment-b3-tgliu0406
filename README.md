# Redesign of BC Liquor Store App

I chose Option A - BC Liquor app for this particular coding assignment. Here is the link to my redesigned BC Liquor Store App: [BC Liquor Store App](https://tgliu.shinyapps.io/assignment-b3-tgliu0406/). 
This is a shiny app that is built upon [an existing app](https://daattali.com/shiny/bcl/) created by AttaliTech.

## Description

Building on the given version of the BC Liquor Store App, my app added the following features that made it more interactive and interesting:

1. A _sweetness filter_ that allows users to filter the liquors by sweetness.
2. A _country of origin filter_ that allow the users to search for multiple countries of origin at once instead of one country at a time.
3. An _image of the BC Liquor Store_ to make the app more visually appealing.

## Data Source

The data used in the app is credited to [BC Liquor Store Product Price List](http://pub.data.gov.bc.ca/datasets/176284/BC_Liquor_Store_Product_Price_List.csv) obtained from BC government webpage.
